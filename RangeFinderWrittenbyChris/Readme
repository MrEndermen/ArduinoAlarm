This is a different piece of code than the one I wrote. I had my coworker assist me with fixing mine, and he changed it to this. It's using different things than what I learned about so it's  quite complicated. He commented it out for me to understand everything a bit more clearly so when i'm reading it over or making adjustments I know what i'm doing. Really the only thing that needs to be adjusted is the range option. Currently it's only 1 meter. It may want to be increased to 2 or 3 meters for a real world test.
